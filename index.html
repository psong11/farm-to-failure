                            [EXAMPLE] [Outline the obesity problem in the world] Obesity is one of the world’s largest health problems – one that has shifted from being a problem in rich countries, to one that spans all income levels.

                            The Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes and risk factors for death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet.3 These estimates of the annual number of deaths attributed to a wide range of risk factors are shown here. This chart is shown for the global total, but can be explored for any country or region using the “change country” toggle.

                            Obesity – defined as having a high body-mass index – is a risk factor for several of the world’s leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various types of cancer.4 Obesity does not directly cause of any of these health impacts but can increase their likelihood of occurring. In the chart we see that it is one of the leading risk factors for death globally.

                            According to the Global Burden of Disease study 4.7 million people died prematurely in 2017 as a result of obesity. To put this into context: this was close to four times the number that died in road accidents, and close to five times the number that died from HIV/AIDS in 2017.

            <p>In the end, we just want to reiterate our message that fast food has negative effects on society, albeit very tasty to eat once in a while. It is important that society is aware of the effects that it has and the correlations it implies with other health factors like mental health. Long story short, if we care about our future generations, we need to change the way we look at fast food.</p>
